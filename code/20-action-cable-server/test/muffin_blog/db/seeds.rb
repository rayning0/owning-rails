Post.create title: "Blueberry Muffins", body: "These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!"

Post.create title: "Chocolate Chip Muffins", body: "You won't believe how easily and quickly you can have chocolate chip muffins on the table using this recipe."
